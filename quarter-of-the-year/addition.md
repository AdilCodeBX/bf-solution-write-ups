# [addition](https://edabit.com/challenge/3LpBLgNRyaHMvNb4j)

```js
function addition(a, b) {
  let result = a + b;
  return result;
}
```

## Strategy

- **Approach:** The approach to the addition function involves straightforward
  arithmetic. Given two input numbers, `a` and `b`, the function simply adds
  them together to produce the result.

## Implementation

addition(a, b): This function takes two parameters, a and b, adds them together
using the + operator, and stores the result in the variable result.

## Possible Refactors

This strategy could also be implemented with these Implementation ...

- a long `if else if else` statement
- a long `while`,
