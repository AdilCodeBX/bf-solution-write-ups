const addition = (a, b) => a + b;
```

## Strategy

perform addition. It utilizes arrow function syntax to take two input
parameters, a and b, and adds them together using the + operator.

## Implementation

b, and returning their sum calculated using the + operator. javascript

This function's functionality could be preserved while exploring these possible
refactorings:

Using a traditional function declaration syntax instead of an arrow function.
Employing destructuring to directly extract a and b from an object parameter.
Implementing error handling to ensure a and b are numeric values.
